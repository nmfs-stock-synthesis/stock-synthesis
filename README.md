# Stock Synthesis 3.30

Stock Synthesis (SS or SS3) is a generalized age-structured population dynamics model implemented in [ADMB](http://www.admb-project.org/). It is used to assess the effect of fisheries on fish and shellfish stocks while taking into account the influence of environmental factors.

## Installation

Download the [latest compiled versions](https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/document-library/-/document_library/0LmuycloZeIt/view/5042555).

## Usage

To learn more about how to use stock synthesis, see the [getting started guide with SS guide](https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/document-library/-/document_library/0LmuycloZeIt/view_file/7137387). To learn how to build your own models in SS, see the [Develop an SS model guide](https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/document-library/-/document_library/0LmuycloZeIt/view_file/7137399).

The [SS user manual](https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/document-library/-/document_library/0LmuycloZeIt/view_file/11684231) provides the complete documentation of SS, while the [helper spreadsheets](https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/document-library/-/document_library/0LmuycloZeIt/view/978337) are useful cheatsheets that outline inputs necessary for options that are widely used within SS.

## Tools for working with SS

As SS usage has grown, so has the number of tools to work with it. These include:

- [r4ss](github.com/r4ss/r4ss): Create plots of SS output and functions to work with SS in R.
- [ss3sim](github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim): Conduct simulation studies using SS
- [SSI](https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/document-library/-/document_library/0LmuycloZeIt/view/5042951): Stock Synthesis Interface, a GUI for developing and running SS
- [SSMSE](github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/SSMSE): Use SS operating models in Management Strategy Evaluation.
